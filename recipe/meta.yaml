  summary: 'A Python Toolbox for Benchmarking Machine Learning on Partially-Observed Time Series'
  description: |
    To evaluate the performance of algorithms on POTS datasets, a benchmarking toolkit is necessary, hence the ecosystem library BenchPOTS is developed.
    BenchPOTS provides the standard and unified preprocessing pipelines of a variety of POTS datasets.
    It supports a variety of evaluation tasks to help users understand the performance of different algorithms.
